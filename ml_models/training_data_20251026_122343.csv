141,"<p>In a landmark public health achievement, Fiji has been validated by the World Health Organization (WHO) for eliminating trachoma as a public health problem. Trachoma, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) and the world&rsquo;s leading infectious cause of blindness, no longer poses a public health threat in the country.</p><p>Trachoma is the first NTD to be eliminated in Fiji. Fiji is the 26th country to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and the 58th country globally to eliminate at least one NTD.</p><p>&ldquo;WHO congratulates Fiji and its network of global and local partners on reaching this milestone,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;Future generations of Fijians have been given a precious gift in being set free from the suffering that trachoma has inflicted on their ancestors.&rdquo;</p><p>Trachoma is caused by the bacterium <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> and spreads through personal contact, interactions with contaminated surfaces and on flies that have been in contact with eye or nose discharge of an infected person. Repeated infections can lead to scarring, in-turning of the eyelids, and ultimately blindness. Globally, the disease remains endemic in many vulnerable communities where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.</p><h2>Fiji&rsquo;s success story</h2><p>&ldquo;Fiji&rsquo;s success in eliminating trachoma is a beacon of what&rsquo;s possible when communities, governments, and partners unite behind a shared goal&rdquo;, said Dr Saia Ma&rsquo;u Piukala, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a celebration of the power of Pacific leadership and the impact of sustained investment in health. WHO congratulates Fiji and is committed to supporting countries across the Region in advancing health for all so that no one is left behind.&rdquo;</p><p>Trachoma was once a significant public health problem in Fiji, with medical reports from the 1930s and community-based surveys in the 1950s documenting widespread disease and risk of blindness. By the 1980s, the condition had declined markedly, with cataract and refractive error emerging as the main causes of vision loss. </p><p>Concern however was renewed in the 2000s, when rapid assessments suggested high levels of active trachoma in children, prompting the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to launch a comprehensive programme to better understand the situation and take necessary action.</p><p>Since 2012, Fiji has undertaken a series of robust, internationally supported surveys and studies, including population-based prevalence surveys and laboratory testing, to understand the local epidemiology of trachoma and distinguish it from other causes of eye disease. This sustained effort, integrated with school health, water and sanitation initiatives, and community awareness programmes, has confirmed that trachoma is no longer a public health problem in Fiji and that systems are in place to identify and manage future cases. </p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Fiji&rsquo;s elimination of trachoma is a defining moment for health equity in the Pacific,&rdquo; said Honourable Dr Ratu Atonio Rabici Lalabalavu, Minister of Health and Medical Services of Fiji.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This achievement reflects years of coordinated action &ndash; across villages, health facilities and regional platforms &ndash; demonstrating unwavering commitment of our health- care workers, communities leading the change. As we celebrate this milestone, we call on our donors and partners in the Pacific and beyond to continue supporting accelerated action of neglected tropical diseases to address other diseases not only in Fiji, but across the Pacific&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Contribution to global progress<strong> </strong></h2><p>Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases and conditions associated with devastating health, social and economic consequences.

147,"<p>One in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections causing common infections in people worldwide in 2023 were resistant to antibiotic treatments, according to a new World Health Organization (WHO) report launched today. Between 2018 and 2023, antibiotic resistance rose in over 40% of the pathogen-antibiotic combinations monitored, with an average annual increase of 5&ndash;15%.&nbsp;</p><p>Data reported to the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) from over 100 countries cautions that increasing resistance to essential antibiotics poses a growing threat to global health.&nbsp;</p><p>The new <em><a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240116337"">Global antibiotic resistance surveillance report 2025</a></em> presents, for the first time, resistance prevalence estimates across 22 antibiotics used to treat infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, the bloodstream and those used to treat gonorrhoea. The report covers 8 common bacterial pathogens &ndash; <em>Acinetobacter spp.</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em>, non-typhoidal <em>Salmonella spp.</em>, <em>Shigella spp.</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>&ndash;<em> </em>each linked to one or more of these infections.<br /></p><h2>The risk of antibiotic resistance varies across the world&nbsp;</h2><p>WHO estimates that antibiotic resistance is highest in the WHO South-East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, where 1 in 3 reported infections were resistant. In the African Region, 1 in 5 infections was resistant. Resistance is also more common and worsening in places where health systems lack capacity to diagnose or treat bacterial pathogens.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,&rdquo; said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. &ldquo;As countries strengthen their AMR surveillance systems, we must use antibiotics responsibly, and make sure everyone has access to the right medicines, quality-assured diagnostics, and vaccines. Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests.&rdquo;</p><h2>Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are posing the greatest threat<br /></h2><p>The new report notes that drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are becoming more dangerous worldwide, with the greatest burden falling on countries least equipped to respond. Among these, <em>E. coli</em> and <em>K. pneumoniae</em> are the leading drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria found in bloodstream infections. These are among the most severe bacterial infections that often result in sepsis, organ failure, and death. Yet more than 40% of <em>E. coli</em> and over 55% of <em>K. pneumoniae</em> globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first-choice treatment for these infections. In the African Region, resistance even exceeds 70%.&nbsp;</p><p>Other essential life-saving antibiotics, including carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, are losing effectiveness against <em>E. coli</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Salmonella</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter</em>. Carbapenem resistance, once rare, is becoming more frequent, narrowing treatment options and forcing reliance on last-resort antibiotics.

Today, more than four out of five tobacco users worldwide are men, with just under 1&nbsp;billion men still using tobacco.

This means fully implementing and enforcing the MPOWER package and the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, closing loopholes that allow the tobacco and nicotine industries to target children, and regulating new nicotine products like e-cigarettes. It also means raising tobacco taxes, banning advertising, and expanding cessation services so that millions more people can quit.</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly 20% of adults people still use tobacco and nicotine products.

149,"<p>Through landmark new guidelines released today, leading reproductive health agencies are calling for a major shift in how postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is prevented, diagnosed and treated. The recommendations highlight the urgent need for earlier detection and faster intervention &ndash; steps that could save the lives of tens of thousands of women each year.</p><p>Defined as excessive bleeding after childbirth, PPH affects millions of women annually and causes nearly 45&nbsp;000 deaths, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally. Even when not fatal, it can lead to lifelong physical and mental health impacts, from major organ damage to hysterectomies, anxiety and trauma.</p><p>&ldquo;Postpartum haemorrhage is the most dangerous childbirth complication since it can escalate with such alarming speed. While it is not always predictable, deaths are preventable with the right care,&rdquo; said Dr Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care. &ldquo;These guidelines are designed to maximize impact where the burden is highest and resources are most limited &ndash; helping ensure more women survive childbirth and can return home safely to their families.&rdquo;</p><h2>New diagnostic criteria for rapid action</h2><p>Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), the guidelines introduce new objective diagnostic criteria for detecting PPH, based on the <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01639-3/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">largest study</a> on the topic to date &ndash; also published today in The Lancet.</p><p>Many PPH cases occur without identifiable risk factors, meaning <strong>early detection and rapid response</strong> is critical. Yet in many settings, especially where healthcare resources and labour wards are overstretched, delays in treatment result in devastating consequences.</p><p>Typically, PPH has been diagnosed as a blood loss of 500 mL or more. Now, clinicians are also advised to act when the blood loss reaches 300 mL, and any abnormal vital signs have been observed. To diagnose PPH early, doctors and midwives are advised to monitor women closely after birth and use calibrated drapes &ndash; simple devices that collect and accurately quantify lost blood &ndash; so that they can act immediately when criteria are met.</p><p>The guidelines recommend the immediate deployment of the <strong><a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/09-05-2023-lifesaving-solution-dramatically-reduces-severe-bleeding-after-childbirth"">MOTIVE bundle</a> of actions once PPH has been diagnosed. This includes:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>M</strong>assage of the uterus;</li><li><strong>O</strong>xytocic drugs to stimulate contractions;</li><li><strong>T</strong>ranexamic acid (TXA) to reduce bleeding;</li><li><strong>I</strong>ntravenous fluids;</li><li><strong>V</strong>aginal and genital tract examination; and</li><li><strong>E</strong>scalation of care if bleeding persists.</li></ul><p>In rare cases where bleeding continues, the guidelines recommend effective interventions such as surgery or blood transfusion to safely stabilize a woman&rsquo;s condition until further treatment becomes available.</p><p>&ldquo;Women affected by PPH need care that is fast, feasible, effective and drives progress towards eliminating PPH-related deaths,&rdquo; said Professor Anne Beatrice Kihara, President of FIGO. &ldquo;These guidelines take a proactive approach of readiness, recognition and response. They are designed to ensure real-world impact &ndash; empowering health workers to deliver the right care, at the right time, and in a wide range of contexts.&rdquo;</p><h2>Reducing risks through effective prevention</h2><p>The guidelines emphasize the importance of good antenatal and postnatal care to mitigate critical risk factors such as anaemia, which is highly prevalent in low- and lower-middle income countries. Anaemia increases the likelihood of PPH and worsens outcomes if it occurs. Recommendations for anaemic mothers include daily oral iron and folate during pregnancy and intravenous iron transfusions when rapid correction is needed, including after PPH, or, if oral therapy fails.</p><p>The publication also discourages unsafe practices such as routine episiotomies while promoting preventive techniques like perineal massage in late pregnancy, so as to reduce the likelihood of trauma and severe bleeding after birth.</p><p>During the third stage of labour, the guidelines recommend administering a quality-assured uterotonic to support uterine contraction, preferably oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin as an alternative. If intravenous options are not available and the cold chain is unreliable, misoprostol may be used as a last resort.</p><p>&ldquo;Midwives know first-hand how quickly postpartum haemorrhage can escalate and cost lives,&rdquo; said Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, ICM&rsquo;s Chief Midwife. &ldquo;These guidelines are a game-changer. But to end preventable deaths from PPH, we need more than evidence and protocols. We call on governments, health systems, donors, and partners to step up, adopt these recommendations, adopt them quickly, and invest in midwives and maternal care so that postpartum haemorrhage becomes a tragedy of the past.&rdquo;</p><p>The guidelines are accompanied by a <a href=""https://www.who.int/tools/bleeding-after-birth"">suite of training and implementation resources</a>, developed with partners including UNFPA. These tools consist of practical modules for frontline health workers, national-level guides for introducing new practices, and simulation-based training to strengthen emergency response.</p><p>These consolidated guidelines &ndash; the first to uniquely focus on PPH &ndash; are being launched at the 2025 FIGO World Congress in Cape Town, South Africa. They are a crucial step in the implementation of the <a href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240081802"">Global roadmap to combat postpartum haemorrhage </a> between 2023 and 2030.<br />&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Notes for editors</strong></h3><p>The guidelines contain 51 recommendations, drawing together existing and new evidence-based recommendations relevant to preventing, diagnosing and treating PPH. </p><p>A <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01639-3/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">new study</a> from WHO and the UN Special Programme on Human Reproduction (HRP) on diagnostic accuracy of indicators of serious postpartum bleeding involving over 300 000 women across 23 countries was also published today in The Lancet: </p><p><em>Gallos I, Williams CR, Price MJ, Tobias A, Devall A, Allotey J et al.
