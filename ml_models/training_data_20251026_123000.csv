487,"Prof Elizabeth Bukusi, Programme Director of LEA-WH: “This Programme is a bold step toward a more equitable and innovative future for women’s health across the continent.”The Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) has announced a
Sh516 million ($4 million) initiative to strengthen women’s health research and
leadership across Africa.Dubbed the Leadership for Innovation and Excellence in
Accelerating Research on Women’s Health (LEA-WH) Programme, the three-year project,
funded through an investment by the Gates Foundation, will begin in January
2026.The institute said the programme seeks to mentor a new
generation of African scientists, researchers and innovators to design locally
driven solutions for women’s health challenges. Sub-Saharan Africa, the
institute noted, continues to bear a high burden of women’s health conditions
that are understudied and underfunded.“The LEA-WH Programme represents KEMRI’s continued
commitment to building scientific leadership that is inclusive, innovative, and
African-led,” said Prof Elijah Songok, Director General of Kemri. “By
empowering scientists to lead groundbreaking research and innovation, we are
investing in the future of Africa’s health and development.”He said the initiative will promote locally led research,
support scalable innovations, and drive evidence-based solutions tailored to
Africa’s unique health needs.Through the LEA-WH Programme, Kemri hopes to create a
sustainable model for excellence in women’s health research. By 2033, the
programme aims to bring five to ten innovative products to market testing,
support up to ten startups, facilitate patent applications, and help 20–50 per
cent of its scholars secure research grants. It also plans to catalyse US$3–5
million in follow-on funding for innovation and research initiatives.In addition, the programme will build a continental alumni
network and promote a policy environment that encourages innovation and
evidence-based decision-making. An annual ScienceX Africa Summit will provide a
platform for mentorship, collaboration and knowledge exchange among Africa’s
emerging and established health researchers.“Our vision is to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem where
African researchers and innovators can lead in designing and implementing
transformative solutions for women’s health,” said Prof Elizabeth Anne Bukusi,
Programme Director of LEA-WH. “This Programme is a bold step toward a more
equitable and innovative future for women’s health across the continent.”The fellowship will be implemented in collaboration with the
United States National Academy of Medicine, with oversight from an advisory
council chaired by Prof Songok. Prof Bukusi will lead the programme with
support from Dr Martin Bundi (Curriculum Development), Prof Nelly Mugo
(Research & Development and Technical Training), and Dr Rose Bosire
(Leadership Development)—all senior scientists at Kemri.The institute described the initiative as part of its
broader mission to “advance scientific excellence, promote gender equity in
research, and champion African-led innovation in health.” The institute,
established in 1979, has grown into one of Africa’s leading centres of
excellence in medical research and continues to play a key role in shaping
health policy and innovation on the continent.",,2025-10-19 12:03:09.073188,0.0,,['health'],0,0,news,,,Kemri launches Sh516m plan to support women in health research,The Star,https://www.the-star.co.ke/health/2025-10-11-kemri-launches-sh516m-plan-to-support-women-in-health-research,,0.0,,,,,,2025-10-19,0,0.1538461538461538,True,True,3335,462,0,0,1,1,0,0
